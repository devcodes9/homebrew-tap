  # agsearch is a single stdlib-only script, so it needs an interpreter, not a
  # Python environment. `uses_from_macos` takes the system python3 on macOS and
  # only pulls brew's on Linux. `depends_on "python@3.13"` would drag in seven
  # packages (openssl, sqlite, readline, xz, ...) for an interpreter the script
  # never uses. Same shape as the ddgr formula in homebrew-core.

    # Homebrew's cookbook calls a --version-only test insufficient, and it would
    # not prove much here anyway. This exercises the real path: index a corpus,
    # match a query, print the hit.
    #
    # Three traps this avoids, all found the hard way:
    #   - HOME must point inside testpath, or the sandbox blocks the cache write.
    #   - An empty HOME exits 1 ("No indexed sessions found"), so the fixture
    #     session has to exist before agsearch runs.
    #   - `-n` highlights every query term with ANSI codes even when piped, so
    #     "stripe tax id" is NOT a contiguous substring of the output. Assert on
    #     unhighlighted text instead.
